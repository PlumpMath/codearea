Live demo [here](http://docview.cnodejs.net/leaf/projects/textareaEditor/editor.html?html),  
but only works for Firefox, as I didn't get clear about `event.charCode`.  
Someone may folk it, (or I'll trying to fix it when I get familiar with details about this).  

I'm tring to make textarea more like a code area, just some basic features like  
indentation, auto indent, delete line, move line, etc. ,  

There are three configure files:
`map_key.coffee`: list the available shortcuts, most of them haven't been deployed yet  
`editor.coffee`: basic functions to handle lines of content,  
`key_handler.coffee`: the behavior of shortcuts  

The schedule is like this:  
1. apply `event_handler` to the `id` of a `<textarea>` element,  
2. when event was caught, `map_keys` will choose the spection function to response,  
3. use `tool.wrap_text` to abstract(?...) the text, return as an object,  
4. analyze the object(as `now`), create a new object names `obj` of the result,  
5. use `tool.write_text` to draw texts in the `<textarea>`  

When adding new shortcuts:  
1. lookup the `map_key.coffee` to fill in details  
2. define the behavior at `key_handler.coffee` with `wrap_text` and `write_text`  

Now we got:  
. ESC  -- blur from textarea  
. Tab  -- indentation using 2(or 1) tabs  
. Shift Tab  -- remove indentation one step  
. Ctrl l  -- select line  
. Ctrl Enter  -- new line with indentation  
. Ctrl u  -- remove the words inline before the curse  
. Ctrl k  -- remove words after the curse in the same line  
. Ctrl Shift Up  -- move lines up  
. Ctrl Shift Down  -- move lines down  
. Ctrl Shift k  -- remove current line  
. Ctrl Shift d  -- duplicate current line  

Going to do:  
1. auto close brackets  
2. auto remove brackets by pair
