Live demo [here](http://docview.cnodejs.net/leaf/projects/textareaEditor/editor.html?html),  
but only works for Firefox, as I didn't get clear about `event.charCode`.  
Someone may folk it, (or I'll trying to fix it when I get familiar with details about this).  

I'm tring to make textarea more like a code area, just some basic features like  
indentation, auto indent, delete line, move line, etc. ,  

There are three configure files:
`map_key.coffee`: list the available shortcuts, most of them haven't been deployed yet  
`editor.coffee`: basic functions to handle lines of content,  
`key_handler.coffee`: the behavior of shortcuts   

The schedule is like this:  
1. apply `event_handler` to the `id` of a `<textarea>` element,  
2. when event was caught, `map_keys` will choose the spection function to response,  
3. use `tool.wrap_text` to abstract(?...) the text, return as an object,  
4. analyze the object(as `now`), create a new object names `obj` of the result,  
5. use `tool.write_text` to draw texts in the `<textarea>`

The biggest problem is `event.charCode`, are different in Firefox and Chrome..  
So I should learn basic JS knowledge first, that's.. I'll try..
